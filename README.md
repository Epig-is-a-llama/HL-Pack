# HL-Pack

None of these projects are my own, I have simply compiled all of these for easy downloading by members of the HL community.


To install either: 
- Download a zip from the latest release (https://github.com/Epig-is-a-llama/HL-Pack/releases) and then unzip into a new folder.
- or
- Look at the mod names and versions in the `mods` folder and then set the configs to match those which can be found in `config` and `defaultconfigs` (including the correct forge version) into a new folder.

From there install the forge version to client and then go to your launcher and map the new folder into a new profile and set the forge version as the version that profile should use. Then allocate a sufficent amount of RAM (8GB to 10GB is ideal, the pack will warn you if you allocate insufficent or too much RAM).
If you followed the instructions correctly the pack should load first try and you will be able to play on the server, infomation such as IP can be found at: https://discord.com/channels/933492547114926140/1130606015864373258 (server link: https://discord.gg/26JfuxCPFf).
